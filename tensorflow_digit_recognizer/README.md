# Digit Recognizer with TensorFlow

This is a simple machine learning project using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## How It Works
- Loads the MNIST dataset
- Preprocesses the images and labels
- Builds a neural network with 2 hidden layers
- Trains the model for 5 epochs
- Evaluates accuracy on the test set

## How to Run

1. Install TensorFlow:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

2. Run the Python script:
```
python digit_recognizer.py
```

## Output
Displays training progress and final test accuracy.
